			<h3>The definition of a good About Us page</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="span5 offset1">
				I need to start this article by qualifying what makes an amazing
				About Us page. The reason for this is that some About Us pages look
				amazing but have terrible content whilst others look terrible but
				grab your attention immediately. The list I have compiled here are
				based on the fact that they: <br>
				<h3>Get the point across</h3>
				First and foremost an About Us page has to get a point across.
				Everything else is completely useless unless the content and the
				layout is achieving a goal. That goal is to tell the user who you
				are by showing them what you can do for them or have done for
				others. <br>
				<h3>Give you the information you need</h3>
				Some About Us pages spend the whole time talking about what it is
				that the company does and nothing about the staff members. Some do
				the opposite. Unless the page gives the information that you need
				based on the type of site you are on then it won’t make the list. <br>
				<h3>Give you social proof, testimonials and other authenticity
					statements</h3>
				A good About Us page always needs to have some mention of past
				successes, achievements, social proof, etc. Giving concrete examples
				of why your site or blog is worth reading is extremely important for
				these pages. <br>

				<h3>Do not let design elements negate the potency</h3>
				Some of the About Us pages I am about to show you will make you weep
				because they are so beautiful. Some not so much. But it is important
				to note that I haven’t included any pages on here purely because
				they look nice. This last dot point is all about that Blue-Shirt
				Trust; as long as the design doesn’t detract from the message I’m
				cool with however it looks. I didn’t want to go in to too much
				detail here because I am going to talk about the advantages of each
				About Us page as we go through them. I’m hoping to use this post as
				a way of showing you what I believe you should be doing on your own
				page. <br>
				<h3>Special tip for About Page conversions</h3>
				Since writing this post I have included an Aweber sign up form on my
				About page and have seen a hugely successful subscriber rate. It
				seems that people want to subscribe to you while they are reading
				about you!
